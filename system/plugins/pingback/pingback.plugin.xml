			<p>When this plugin is active, other sites that link to specific posts can "ping" them with a special request.  This request is registered by Habari as a comment that is processed via the usual system.</p>
			<p>When you write a post that links to other sites, Habari will attempt to ping those URLs too.  Depending on the capabilities of the pinged server, your post may appear as a comment on the remote site.</p>
			<p>Pingbacks are generally less spam-prone than Trackbacks (which are not implemented in this plugin), because when the ping is received, Habari visits the pinging site to ensure that the provided link to your post does actually exist.</p>
